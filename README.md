# Welcome to my Profile!

My name is Taylor and I'm a software developer in Vancouver Canada. After working in account management and business development for several years, I took a number of self taught courses on python and web development based on my interest in the field. I love problem solving and increasing efficiency, and I found I really have a passion for learning more. 

After a year of consideration and small amounts of self teaching on the side, I joined BrainStation, a full-time software development bootcamp in Vancouver to take the next steps in my career. I loved the experience, the education team, and the connections I made along the way.

Having graduated, I'm looking to refine my current projects (which I would encourage you to check out!), add new ones, and continue to learn. I would be so happy to join a company and a team of like-minded developers to further grow my skills ðŸ˜ƒ
